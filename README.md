It all started in 2011, where I was courious about how Java programming Language and SQL queries worked. I used to work for a tech company where they trainned me to edit queries and do ETLs to present the data to account and customer executives. 
I decided to enroll myself in the Software Engineer carreer after this. It was not easy, I hated it! 

It was not but a while after that when I saw a tv series called Mr. Robot, and then I fell in love with cybersecurity. 

I started searching for courses and information online. I enrolled in a couple. I landed a job as User Access Reviewer, I was feeling a step closer to my goal. Then I moved into a different position as a Security Auditor, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and have a more dynamic and complex role. 

And this is my starting point and how I started to learn how to become a PenTester. 

This is where the whole Hacker Notes themed started, in IG you can find me with the same name, there, you can find a more aesthetic panorama of what I study, here, I plan to add all my notes and preparation for different certifications.

And If I ever make it, my dos and don'ts on how to land a job as a PenTester. Go to Wiki to learn more. 

Happy hacking!
